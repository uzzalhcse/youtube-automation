You are a visual narration mapping assistant.

I will give you .srt subtitle data. Your job is to output a dense series of visual prompts that match each key beat of the spoken narration.

🧠 Visual Chunking Rules:

New sentence? → Start a new visual unit

Short line (e.g. <3s or <6 words)? → Merge only if it feels like a continuous idea

Powerful/emotional words (e.g. “Boom.” “Yeah?” “Lazy.”) → Give their own visual moment

Conceptual/emotional shifts? → Start new visual

If uncertain: Prefer more visuals, not fewer

⚠️ Avoid merging more than 10 seconds of narration into a single prompt.

🎨 Visual Prompt Template:

For each chunk, generate a unique visual using this template:



A hand-drawn cartoon scene with a stick figure in a red scarf. Scene: {scene_concept}. Style: sketchy black-and-white with minimal red accent. Background in soft beige. Emotion: {emotion_or_mood}.

🧠 scene_concept should reflect what’s happening or being said (literal, metaphorical, or symbolic).



💬 emotion_or_mood should capture the tone: hopeful, anxious, dreamy, frustrated, etc.

✅ Output Format:

A JSON array like this:

[

  {

    "start": "00:00:00,000",

    "end": "00:00:04,940",

    "prompt": "A stick figure in a red scarf looks at the sky full of clocks and stars, dreaming. Minimalist cartoon style. Mood: hopeful."

  },

  ...

]

🎯 Target: Output ~1 visual per idea or emotional beat. Do not compress multiple beats into one. If in doubt, split it.

Now here is the .srt file:

1

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940

Ever feel like you're meant for something

bigger, but your days look exactly the same?



2

00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,300

Like you've got all these dreams in your

head, but somehow, you still end up doom-scrolling



3

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,500

at midnight, half-dressed, surrounded by

snack wrappers.



4

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,120

If that's you, welcome to the club, and

buckle up, 'cause this video might just change



5

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,720

your life.



6

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,220

Let me be real with you.



7

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,000

There's this weird space a lot of us live

in, where we're super ambitious, but also kind



8

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,520

of lazy, not don't want anything, from

life lazy, more like mentally exhausted, stuck



9

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200

in quicksand, overthinking, every move

kindle is.



10

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200

Sound familiar?



11

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200

Yeah?



12

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,360

I've been there, too.



13

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,880

You wake up with ideas buzzing in your

head.



14

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,840

I could start that thing today.



15

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,080

I should finally change my situation, but

then, boom, it's suddenly 6 p.m., you've barely



16

00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,080

moved, maybe scrolled a bit, watched a few

videos, felt guilty about it, and then you



17

00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,300

do it all over again tomorrow.



18

00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,640

But here's the scary truth.



19

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760

Nobody tells you, the clock is ticking,

and nothing's.



20

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,040

Changing, let's do some quick math.



21

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,760

There are 365 days in a year, that's 8,760

hours.
